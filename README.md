## How to install an airgeddon plugin?
It is already explained on [airgeddon Wiki](https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon/wiki) on [this section](https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon/wiki/Plugins%20System#how-can-i-install-a-plugin-already-done-by-somebody) with more detail. Anyway, summarizing, it consists in just copying the .sh plugin file to the airgeddon's plugins directory.

Plugins system feature is available from ```airgeddon>=10.0```.
